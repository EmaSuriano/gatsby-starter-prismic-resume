# Resume builder for engineers by an Engineer

Recently I've been in the process of updating my Resume, which was so outdated that it didn't even match the city I'm currently living right. But in these occasion I wanted to do something different, something that will highlighted it from others! So I ended up coding my Resume, treating it like a real project, using the latest technologies and best practices out there!
